# Rock, Paper, Scissors (Python)

A command-line **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python where a user plays against the computer. This project was created as part of **CSCI 1170** and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, user input validation, and basic randomness.

##  Features
- Interactive command-line gameplay
- User vs. computer logic
- Randomized computer choices
- Tracks:
  - Total games played
  - User wins
  - Computer wins
  - Ties
- Exit option (`-1` to quit)
- Deterministic randomness using a fixed seed (useful for testing)

---

##  Concepts Used
- Functions and modular design
- `while` loops
- Conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)
- Python `random` module
- Formatted output with f-strings
- Basic game-state tracking
